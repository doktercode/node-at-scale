/**
 * Path module in Node.js:
 * ----------------------
 * 
 *      Node.js provides path module to normalize, join, and resolve file system paths.
 *      Find relative paths, extract components from paths and determine existence of paths.
 *      The path module simply manipulates strings and does not interact with the file system to validate the paths.
 * 
 *      Functions provided by path module in node.js:
 *      ---------------------------------------------
 *      
 *       path.normalize() - Ensure a predictable format when a source is untrusted or unreliable.
 *       path.join() - Build a single path from path segments.
 *       path.dirname() - Provides a directory name out of the path.
 *       path.basename() - Provide the final path segment.
 *       path.extname() - Use to slice from the last period(.) to the end of the path string.
 *       path.resolve() - Resolve a list of path instructions into an absolute path.
 *       
 *
